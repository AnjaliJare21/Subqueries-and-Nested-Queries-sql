# Subqueries-and-Nested-Queries-sql
demonstrates the use of subqueries and nested queries in SQL

This project explores advanced SQL querying techniques using subqueries and nested logic. It features two main tables — `Employees` and `Departments` — and demonstrates how to use:

- Scalar subqueries in SELECT
- Correlated subqueries
- Subqueries in WHERE and FROM clauses
- `IN`, `EXISTS`, and derived tables
